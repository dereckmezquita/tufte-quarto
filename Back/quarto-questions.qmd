# Questions

- Why `Welcome` from  `/index.qmd` is appearing in pdf?
- `Part` `/background.qmd` is not appearing in TOC (pdf).  Is this a Tufte-book.cls problem?
- pdf figures in website are being framed. Why? 
- Header configuration is set to include short-tile instead of title.  Couldn't insert just a space, though.  Why blank space without mathmode didn't work?


# Known-issues

1. Tufte-book can't handle label inside caption.

    Tufte-book.cls breaks when processing the line bellow:
    ```markdown
    ![A way of flying](/Images/goya.jpg){.column-body #fig-goya}
    ```
    which becomes:

    ```tex
    \begin{figure}

    {\centering \includegraphics{Images/goya.jpg}

    }

    \caption{\label{fig-goya}A way of flying}

    \end{figure}
    ```

 2. Can't render svg image in pdf and can't render pdf image in html.
    - current solution is quite ugly: 

    ```markdown
    ::: {.content-hidden unless-format="pdf" }

    ![IBT "genealogy" tree.](/Images/dissertation-map.pdf){.column-margin width=90%}

    :::

    ::: {.content-hidden unless-format="html"}

    ![IBT "genealogy" tree.](/Images/dissertation-map.svg){.column-margin width=90%}

    :::

    ```

3. Tufte-class works only until subsubsection -> ###, #### -> returns error
