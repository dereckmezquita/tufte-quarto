This chapter presents

## The IB Learning Problem

### The IB learning problem setting

### Assumptions

### Thesis

### Comparing to MLT

## The Precision-generalisation trade-off in the IB Curve

## IB and PAC (better title?)

## IB based generalisation bounds

## Connections to PAC-Bayes

-   not specific to DL

-   comparing genealogy

-   comparing assumptions

-   PAC formulation of IB with Shannon-McMillan proof

-   SLT assumes iid sampling vs IT ergodic process

-   The information plane as an Informatino theoretical tool for understanding learning

-   IB bounds

-   Connection of IB and PAC Bayes
