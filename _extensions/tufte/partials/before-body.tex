The public is more familiar with bad design than good design.
It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, 
because that is what it lives with. 
The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.

\openepigraph{%
A designer knows that he has achieved perfection 
not when there is nothing left to add, 
but when there is nothing left to take away.

If I had not participated fully in all these activities, 
literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, 
because I would never have thought of them or perceived 
why they were important.
}{Donald E. Knuth}
